# Advanced-Cricket-Tournament-Simulation-

This Python program simulates a cricket tournament involving various teams with an advanced level of detail. The application is designed to mimic real-world cricket matches and statistics.

Program Overview
The program consists of several key classes:

Player: Represents a cricket player and contains information on player stats such as batting, bowling, fielding, running, and experience.
Team: This represents a cricket team and consists of players. It has methods for selecting the captain, sending the next player to the field, choosing a bowler for an over, and deciding the batting order.
Field: This represents the cricket field and contains factors like field size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage, which can impact the probabilities of the simulation.
Umpire: Handles the simulation of cricket ball outcomes, keeps track of scores, wickets, and overs, and makes decisions on LBWs, catches, no-balls, wide-balls, etc.
Commentator: Provides commentary for each ball and over using match statistics.
Match: Simulates an individual cricket match using objects of the Teams, Field, and Umpire classes. It has methods to start the match, change innings, and end the match.
Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

Create instances of the Player class to represent the players participating in the tournament.
Create instances of the Team class, passing the player instances to represent the teams.
Call the select_captain method on each team to select the captain.
Use the send_next_player method on each team to send the next player to the field.
Use the choose_bowler method on each team to choose a bowler for an over.
Create an instance of the Field class, providing the field size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage.
Create an instance of the Match class, passing the team instances and field instances.
Call the start_match method on the match instance to begin the match.
Use the simulate_innings method on the match instance to simulate the innings of the teams.
Implement the scoring and decision-making logic within the simulate_innings method.
Optionally, use the change_innings method on the match instance to switch innings.
Implement the end_match method to end the match and determine the winner.
Evaluation Criteria
The code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective Organization and Structure of Code: The codebase should be well-structured with the appropriate use of functions, classes, and modules. Clear and meaningful names should be used for variables and functions, following Python coding conventions.
Adherence to Python Coding Conventions and Best Practices: The code should follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting. It should be readable and maintainable with proper indentation, comments, and docstrings.
Proper Utilization of Data Structures and Algorithms: Suitable data structures and algorithms should be used to efficiently represent and manipulate tournament data. This might include using dictionaries, and lists, and leveraging object-oriented programming concepts effectively.
Modular and Reusable Code Design: The code should be designed in a modular manner, promoting reusability and maintainability.
